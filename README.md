# ResumeDesign

## [Check out the demo](https://dilionscode.github.io/HTML-Resume/)

This was a design I made for a client and I thought I would share!

You can export the html in the browser as a PDF after editing it or edit it as a PDF.

# Exporting to PDF
* Open the HTML file with the browser.
* On Firefox:
  * You probably need to remove any page margins in **about:config**.
  * Uncheck **Ignore Scaling and Shrink To Fit Page Width**.
  * Check **Print Background Colors**.
  * Clear out the headers and footers.
  * Save as PDF.
* On Google Chrome:
  * Set **Margin** to **None**.
  * Print **Background Graphics**.
  * Don't print headers and footers.
  * Save as PDF.
